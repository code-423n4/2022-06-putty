Any chance this contest can be extended until Tues? Having 3/5 days be either weekend or July 4th holiday is making it tricky to finish in time.

Hey noticed tests (incl. failing tests) affect gas report results.


[07/02/2022 10:43 PM] zer0dot
I guess the most reliable gas stat is the maximum then yeah? Cause it for sure won't be a revert


[07/02/2022 10:44 PM] zer0dot
I was noting the avg gas, then I commented a reverting test, and now the avg gas went up :kekhands:


[07/03/2022 8:09 AM] out.eth
Hi do you mean to say that there are failing tests? Or are you talking about tests that check for the revert case? (There should be no failing tests)


[07/03/2022 9:22 AM] elku.cryptos
Does the order in which tests are passed different in each run? Or is it just printed in different order by forge on different runs?


[07/03/2022 10:28 AM] out.eth
forge runs all of the tests in parallel so there is no guaranteed ordering (afaik). they get logged to the console as each test file is fully run. then the tests within each test file are logged alphabetically.

[07/03/2022 2:32 PM] zer0dot
Hi yeah revert cases


[07/03/2022 2:54 PM] out.eth
Ok, to get a specific gas cost for a call there are some helper methods here: startMeasuringGas and stopMeasuringGas https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/main/contracts/test/shared/Fixture.t.sol#L52

(I just noticed that there it says -20_000 in stopMeasuringGas. This should be changed to -100)

But otherwise in the gas report any optimisation should improve min, avg, median, max across the board (including for revert cases).

gg everyone! I'm afraid I broke the Rinkeby frontend in a few places by opening orders against other Putty position tokens, like this one: https://rinkeby.putty.finance/order/0x6ce280f5bd82103ad553ad497bda9e16c1cfecd351dd2a60673215bf08957d67. If you're debugging these, that's what's going on here.

is there a way that someone is missing? I have submitted and not on the list


[08/02/2022 6:55 PM] 0xa5df
Was it multiple QA/gas reports? Because they get invalidated if you post more than one (for each category - QA/gas)


[08/02/2022 7:07 PM] Noah3o6#2496
not that I know, could this have something to do with the auth, at this time I had trouble with this. I took a look in my email account and can’t see a submition email too.


[08/02/2022 7:15 PM] 0xa5df
If you didn't get an email it sounds more like there was a submission issue, maybe you can ask the admins or something (I doubt they'd be able to do something about past contest, but maybe they'll be able to fix it for future ones)


[08/02/2022 7:15 PM] Noah3o6#2496
okay thanks for your help


[08/02/2022 7:16 PM] 0xa5df

[08/02/2022 7:35 PM] cloudellie
Hey @Noah3o6, sorry to hear this happened. If you don't receive an email confirmation of your submissions, it's always a good idea to submit a Help Desk request so we can look into it right away. 

Has your auth issue been resolved, or are you still having problems with that?


[08/02/2022 7:40 PM] Noah3o6#2496
Yes, next time if something like this happen I will do so.
Two the second point, it’s solved kartoonjoy helped me and know everything works fine.

I had submitted 8 gas finding, i can't see my name in list


[08/06/2022 8:47 AM] rotcivegaf
Maybe submit an invalid report


[08/06/2022 9:12 AM] sm4rty_
Did you submitted all in gas finding as one report?


[08/06/2022 9:12 AM] Amithuddar#9571
No separate all


[08/06/2022 9:13 AM] sm4rty_
It will be invalidated then..


[08/06/2022 9:13 AM] Amithuddar#9571
So all gas finding should be made one report and submit only once?

thanks, first time mistake happen, if they do them one report then i can give more time to code4areana else i can't give time because i can't waste one more month figuring out


[08/07/2022 3:10 PM] JohnSmith#1623
The truth is you are not alone in this, I did this mistake too, and lately we got a lot of new wardens, who did not pay attention too, like I bet dozens did same mistake only last month. So do you suggest we should make exception for you or for everyone, and what about people, whose work already has been invalidated?


[08/07/2022 3:13 PM] Amithuddar#9571
putty results out you can leave it,  but remaining contest:New Blockchain,  Juicebox,  Juicebox, Swivel,ENS ,  Swivel, Yield, Golom, Axelar. Results are not yet out they can be made one report. code4arena should support white hat hackers like us who who want to make system secure, we all are working for good cause


[08/07/2022 3:40 PM] sm4rty_
Bro, the team  works very hard for c4 contests. Although you can request them to fix it, But they are not obliged to fix mistakes you made instead of proper warnings. I too made the same mistake in few contest, I didn't got paid for any of them including opensea, I am OK with it, as it was my mistake.  Move on and Just make sure you don't do it again.

Be respectful Bro, why are talking about revenge?  I can understand you didn't got paid but this is certainly not the way to show your anger.


[08/07/2022 3:48 PM] Amithuddar#9571
sorry, it's painful to see month of work for nothing and nothing can be done


[08/07/2022 3:54 PM] JohnSmith#1623
Well, there is no answer from c4 staff yet.
Maybe they'll put it to a vote, it is a DAO after all 😀


[08/07/2022 3:56 PM] Amithuddar#9571
I am fine if no reply yet all or all vote to make whole month invalid.  DAO is double edge sword


[08/07/2022 4:09 PM] rohan16
@Amithuddar see your concern is absolutely correct that you invested a lot of time in doing all the contest but brother be a bit logical and respectful to the team who is providing you the contest and the rules are already displayed it's not like they are informing to everybody one by one and I guess you are smart enough to overcome your mistake and just forget what you didn't got in the last month just think that a lot of knowledge you gained from the last whole month and apply it on the all upcoming contest and move on in a positive manner with being kind to the c4 team😇

afaik, the amount of wardens only keeps growing , stop being salty

@Amithuddar Unfortunate and I’m sorry for the disappointment. C4 is a contest and staff is bound to apply the rules impartially, so there can’t be a change to your submissions on these contests. 

Your fellow wardens here are giving good advice and I appreciate them doing so. This is a great community and we all work hard to treat people with respect here even when we’re frustrated or disagree.

Consider the rules a smart contract worth studying 🙂 Looking forward to seeing you demonstrate your talent in the future within the guidelines provided!
